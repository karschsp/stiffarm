						<!-- BIO -->
						<a name="bio"></a>
							<section class="">
							<h3 class="major">Bio</h3><p>Snap Infraction is Steve Karsch and Tony Iannuzzi and they share a brain and they don’t like writing about themselves in the third-person or pretending that their bio was written by some esteemed rock journalist that they paid to write their bio. They like guitars n drums n amps n rock n roll: Beatles, Zepp, Stones, Petty, VH, Foos, Queens (and Queen), Replacements, Rush, Yes, and on and on and on and on till the break of dawn. If you have several hours to spare, ask them about the 70s, they were barely there but they remember the music well.</p>
							<p>They've played in bands. Many bands. Most you’ve probably never heard of. Actually, if you’ve ever heard of them and have several MORE hours to spare, get in touch, or get a job; you have too much time on your hands.</p>
							<p>They are rarely in the same room at the same time.</p>
							<p>Every two years or so, they release some new music. They’re kind of like cicadas in that way, but not like the cicadas who drop from the trees and get stuck in your hair. That's gross.</p>
							<p>Anyway, their first EP <a href="https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/snapinfraction/dbsN">“Chin Music”</a> was released in 2017 and their next EP “Stiff Arm” will be released in 2019 (see? Every two years! Just like we said.)</p>
							<!-- p>The songs on ‘Stiff Arm’ were written by Steve Karsch. Steve Karsch and Tony Iannuzzi performed and recorded them. Some songs are new, some songs are old. These things take time. But in the grand scheme of things, it's but a blink of the eye of the universe.</p>

<p>Snap Infraction mixed the songs except for "Nobody's There" which was mixed by their good friend Cliff Hillis at the Hacienda.</p>

<p>They were also fortunate enough to have some guest performers play on the record. Dave Fecca played lead on Hypocrite and Can You Hear Me Now. Mike Ian played guitar on Hypocrite. Pete Wilkins played bass on Hypocrite.</p>

<p>Tom V mastered the whole thing and fixed all our messes. </p -->
